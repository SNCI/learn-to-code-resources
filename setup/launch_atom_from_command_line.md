## Launch Atom From Command line

Open your Terminal or Cygwin command line and enter `atom` followed by the name of the file you want to open. For example:

```bash
atom file.txt
```
If this does not work, try the following:   

**Windows**  

If entering `atom` from Cygwin results in the output `-bash: atom: command not found`, try `atom.cmd` instead.

**Mac**  

If entering `atom` from Terminal is not working for you, open Atom once from Finder, then select *Atom > Install Shell Commands*.

If this still does not work, reach out to us over Slack!
